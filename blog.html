                <br>
                <p>
                    The past week I've been spending a lot of time working on the next homework assignment. The goal is to create a 
                    weather dashboard using an API. Unlike some other assignments there was no prebuilt CSS or HTML so I got to build 
                    it from the ground up. To be completely honest, it was such a blast.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the first problems I ran into was that the free version of the weather API is pretty limited. If you want to 
                    search by a city name you can only grab the current weather instead of a 5 or 10 day forecast. However, if you want 
                    a forecast you can search by latitude and longitude. Obviously, no one is actually going to search that way so I had 
                    to first request the current forecast which luckily included the coordinates THEN take those coordinates, put them in
                    a variable, and do another GET request from the API for the 5 day forecast. Definitely seemed unneccessary but it was 
                    fun to figure out. Also, why does bootstrap auto fill with the slim version of JQuery? Doesn't seem smart.
                    <br><br>
                    Another thing...I feel like I'm still pretty bad at formatting webpages with CSS, specifically when it comes to adjusting
                    them for small screen sizes. Something I learned this time around was to really use percentages in regards to widths and
                    heights of objects. Then, make a minimum or max width/height to make sure things don't get too out of control. That seems
                    to do a good job. I also seem to forget that you can group cards together which definitely helps with screen size problems.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm pretty close to feeling 100% about this assignment and it's still not due for more than a week so I have plenty of time 
                    to polish it up. In the meantime we are going to be working on our first big project starting on Wednesday. I'm excited to see 
                    what it's like to work on code with a team. I'm imagining that it takes some real skill and organization as well as trust to 
                    do it successfully. It's not 100% yet but I think we might work with an API that deals with snowpack in the Western US.
                    This would be fun for me because of my skiing background. It could show the current snowpack on a map and also compare it to
                    other years. It would definitely take a lot of learning but it could be fun and create a fun website.

                <p>
                    I've started my homework due on Saturday and I'm pretty much done with it! I actually finished all requirements
                    in just an hour or two and since then I've been adding features and making small adjustments to formatting/CSS (those
                    alwasys do seem to take the most time). Some things I learned from this project...
                    <br><br>
                    Using a library, in this case moment.js, to work with time and date. At first it seemed overly complicated but once 
                    I dug more into it it became pretty simple. Going into it I thought using time to adjust the formatting of different
                    boxes would take tons of work. In reality it took maybe 10 lines of code. Pretty neat!
                    <br><br>
                    I also feel really good about event listeners for buttons now. I thought it would be difficult or at least require 
                    lots of code to pair each button with it's specific textbox. However, just giving each a matching value then running 
                    them through a for loop does the job quickly. Overall I feel like I am getting better at making my code DRYer which
                    I feel really good about :).
                    <br><br>
                    Tonight is the first class on server side APIs. I'm hoping this will finally answer my questions on how to do the
                    personal project I've been mentioning.

                <p>
                    Just finished up the second class since winter break. We're getting really into JQuery and so far
                    it's really fun. Obviously it's a great tool and something I'm excited to learn more about. As they
                    say, "write less, do more". 
                    <br><br>
                    One thing I want to learn is how to grab data off of a different website and then reorganize/interpret
                    that data. Maybe that's more of a data science thing? Maybe I'll have to get back into Python...
                    <br><br>
                    In the mean time I need to start with the next assignment. The goal is to make a functional day planner.
                    To be completely honest I have no idea where to start but I'm sure once I get rolling it will come easily.
                    <br><br>
                    Ok! Just a quick one today. I'll update again this weekend. Maybe I'll add some JS and JQuery to this 
                    site too...

                <br>
                <p>
                    First post! Let's play some catch up. Since November I have been enrolled in a Full Stack Web
                    Development Program through the University of Utah and I
                    can't overstate how much I have been enjoying it. Each lesson is liking opening a new door of
                    possibilities (that sounds cheesy I know).
                    <br><br>
                    So far we have learned some HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm enjoying all three but for different
                    reasons. HTML and CSS are fun because of how quickly
                    you can see the results, it's almost like playing with legos. The TA's of the class keep bringing up
                    React which I believe is a framework? But they seem
                    very excited about it which makes me excited too. Using HTML and CSS we all created our own personal
                    websites that includes our portfolios and now this blog!
                    We did so using Bootstrap 4 which is super fun and easy to use.
                    <br><br>
                    After that we learned some basic Javascript stuff. JS is definitely very fun and it's easy to see how 
                    powerful of a language it is. There is obviously PLENTY I don't know about it yet which is why I have 
                    gone out of my way to learn more outside of class. I have been spending a lot of time on codewars and 
                    codeacademy working on my skills that I'm sure will come in handy later.
                    <br><br>
                    For our latest assignment we had to create a quiz using mostly JS. I really enjoyed this because it gave
                    me a real challenge and I had to use a lot of outside resources for help. Also, I got to exeperience my first
                    'why the hell is my code doing this??' bug for several days. YAY! Basically, my iteration variable was going 
                    all over the place. When the user would select the correct answer the program was supposed to give them
                    some points and then move on. However, for some reason I still do not understand, the iteration variable would
                    loop through that for statement several times for each answer. It resulted in some VERY high scores that
                    definitely did not look right. I spent days staring at my code and wondering what the hell was going on. 
                    Eventually, I started thinking like a true coder and instead of fixing the underlying problem I just
                    made it so the program wouldn't listen to itself when it was messing up. Maybe not the best way to fix
                    it but hey it worked. Hopefully I'll learn more eventually so I can go back and truley fix it.
                    <br><br>
                    Since that assignment I have been on winter break. I've been spending my time either working on that
                    assignment, on codewars, or on codeacademy. Plus skiing of course! Later today is my first class back
                    and we're starting JQuery! I'm VERY excited about this because I have a personal project in mind and
                    from the little I know about JQuery it could be the missing piece to the puzzle. We'll see!
