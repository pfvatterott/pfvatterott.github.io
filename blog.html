                <p>
                    Just finished up the second class since winter break. We're getting really into JQuery and so far
                    it's really fun. Obviously it's a great tool and something I'm excited to learn more about. As they
                    say, "write less, do more". 
                    <br><br>
                    One thing I want to learn is how to grab data off of a different website and then reorganize/interpret
                    that data. Maybe that's more of a data science thing? Maybe I'll have to get back into Python...
                    <br><br>
                    In the mean time I need to start with the next assignment. The goal is to make a functional day planner.
                    To be completely honest I have no idea where to start but I'm sure once I get rolling it will come easily.
                    <br><br>
                    Ok! Just a quick one today. I'll update again this weekend.

                <h3>January 4th, 2021</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    First post! Let's play some catch up. Since November I have been enrolled in a Full Stack Web
                    Development Program through the University of Utah and I
                    can't overstate how much I have been enjoying it. Each lesson is liking opening a new door of
                    possibilities (that sounds cheesy I know).
                    <br><br>
                    So far we have learned some HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm enjoying all three but for different
                    reasons. HTML and CSS are fun because of how quickly
                    you can see the results, it's almost like playing with legos. The TA's of the class keep bringing up
                    React which I believe is a framework? But they seem
                    very excited about it which makes me excited too. Using HTML and CSS we all created our own personal
                    websites that includes our portfolios and now this blog!
                    We did so using Bootstrap 4 which is super fun and easy to use.
                    <br><br>
                    After that we learned some basic Javascript stuff. JS is definitely very fun and it's easy to see how 
                    powerful of a language it is. There is obviously PLENTY I don't know about it yet which is why I have 
                    gone out of my way to learn more outside of class. I have been spending a lot of time on codewars and 
                    codeacademy working on my skills that I'm sure will come in handy later.
                    <br><br>
                    For our latest assignment we had to create a quiz using mostly JS. I really enjoyed this because it gave
                    me a real challenge and I had to use a lot of outside resources for help. Also, I got to exeperience my first
                    'why the hell is my code doing this??' bug for several days. YAY! Basically, my iteration variable was going 
                    all over the place. When the user would select the correct answer the program was supposed to give them
                    some points and then move on. However, for some reason I still do not understand, the iteration variable would
                    loop through that for statement several times for each answer. It resulted in some VERY high scores that
                    definitely did not look right. I spent days staring at my code and wondering what the hell was going on. 
                    Eventually, I started thinking like a true coder and instead of fixing the underlying problem I just
                    made it so the program wouldn't listen to itself when it was messing up. Maybe not the best way to fix
                    it but hey it worked. Hopefully I'll learn more eventually so I can go back and truley fix it.
                    <br><br>
                    Since that assignment I have been on winter break. I've been spending my time either working on that
                    assignment, on codewars, or on codeacademy. Plus skiing of course! Later today is my first class back
                    and we're starting JQuery! I'm VERY excited about this because I have a personal project in mind and
                    from the little I know about JQuery it could be the missing piece to the puzzle. We'll see!
