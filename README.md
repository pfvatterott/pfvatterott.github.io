# Personal Portfolio Website    

## Description

For this project I used Bootstrap 4 to completely overhaul my personal portfolio. I learned many things in the process: the grid system, different Bootstrap components, how to have several pages for one website, and how to make a website responsive. 

This website features:

1. A navbar that is unchanged on every page.
2. Links to my email, github, and Instagram.
3. A sticky footer that is unchanged on every page.
4. A contact form (although it is not working).
5. Two different interest pages with functioning caruousels.
6. A portfolio page with five cards on it for each future project.
7. Customized color scheme and fonts.

## Installation
